Description of the project:

In the current climate of soaring energy prices, the company wants to offer a new service by which local clients that are near a source of renewable
energy will have free energy when there is a surplus of energy in that area. The company wants to roll out a
pilot project in which they test this scheme with a subset of customers in May 2024. As a first step, however,
the company needs to have a system that can reliably predict, at least 24 hours in advance, whether there will
be a surplus of energy (of either wind or solar energy) so that they can send out an alert to the customers in
the area to allow them to opt-in to the slot.
To develop such a system, the company has provided access to historical records in the area
from year 2000 until now and they have asked you to check the feasibility of this plan. The company is particularly worried about false positives,
as this would mean that they lose money by offering free electricity to customers when there is not a surplus of
energy therefore incurring a high cost for the company.

How to run /use the code:
please download the notebook where the weather_for_students data folder is in your laptops/desktops for the Load data to work or copy the path into the load data. And run the rest of the code as usual, the code should run without any errors. 

The data loaded for this project is Colchester data and is used to identify the surplus solar energy consumption.

The final coherent dataset is named as colchester_exploration_preprocessed_data which is saved in a CSV file which is used to do the modeling in a different notebook.

Here we are considering solar energy production and consumption to and by the household

Assumptions made through the jupyter notebook:

1) How many solar panels and houses consume solar energy (defining an n)
==> Assuming the total household in Colchester City is 10,000
    Percentage of houses consuming solar energy through the company is 10%
    No of solar panels per household is 2 
    
2) how much surplus energy is provided per hour to a household
==> After calculations the Surplus energy provided per hour to a household    
    is 9.43 kWh
3) Behavioral assumption on how people behave when surplus free energy is 
   provided
==> People may increase energy consumption when it's free.
    They may shift energy-intensive tasks when surplus energy is  
    available.
    They may invest in energy storage solutions to store surplus energy.
    They may participate in energy-saving behaviors or adopt energy- 
    efficient appliances.
 
Other general assumptions based on the code written:

1) The data given to us is time series data.
2) A subset of data is separated to avoid overfitting
2) The data columns have a lot of missing values which have to be 
   treated/filled
3) The plots drawn show periodicity to years clearly in some columns than 
   others 
4) The missing values were treated with the interpolation 'time' method 
   and also imputation with the time method which gave accurate results in  
   treating the missing values.
5) The decomposition plot using STL shows the trend, seasonality, and 
   residuals in the given time series data.
6) The assumptions made from the decomposition plot are 
   TREND: There isn't any clear trend in this case the values remain mostly static across time, but they do seem slightly higher on the right-hand side than  
   on the left.
   SEASONALITY: There is a clear seasonal component that increased seasonally from 2008.
   RESIDUAL: we can see the distribution of data where the residuals are above 2.5 degrees and symmetrically distributed around zero, that's the noise we  
   wont be able to predict
7) The decision-making system implemented here is the Random Forest classifier and Seasonal Naive Forcast which gave very good results for the implementation of this project

Overall Model Performance:
Accuracy: 97.47% indicates that the model correctly predicts the class label for nearly 98% of instances.
Precision: 98.31% suggests that when the model predicts a positive outcome (surplus energy), it is correct approximately 96% of the time.
Recall: 98.26% indicates that the model correctly identifies around 96% of all actual positive instances.
F1 Score: 98.28% is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
ROC AUC Score: 96.75% represents the area under the ROC curve, indicating the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

Analysis of False Positives through Confusion Matrix:
False positives occur when the model predicts surplus energy (positive class) incorrectly when there is no surplus energy (negative class).
In the confusion matrix, false positives are represented by the value in the top-right cell (469 in this case).
False positives can lead to providing free energy to customers when it's not warranted, potentially resulting in financial losses for the company.
Given the relatively low number of false positives compared to the total number of instances (469 out of 27,285), the model's performance in this aspect is generally good.
However, even a small number of false positives can have significant implications, especially if the cost of providing free energy is high.


1) Are you confident that your model fulfills the requirements for the company? 
==> Yes, overall, the model demonstrates strong performance metrics, including high accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score. The relatively low number of false positives indicates that the model effectively minimizes incorrect predictions of surplus energy, which aligns with the company's goal of offering free energy during surplus periods while minimizing financial losses due to false positives.
2) Is it ready to be deployed in May 2024? Are there any limitations they 
   should consider? 
==> The model appears to be in a good position for deployment in May 2024, given its high-performance metrics and the insights provided regarding false positives. However, False positives could still occur due to various reasons, such as fluctuations in renewable energy generation, inaccuracies in forecasting data, or limitations in the model's ability to capture complex patterns. To further minimize false positives,we can consider additional feature engineering, model tuning, or incorporating external factors that may influence energy surplus prediction.
Continuous monitoring and validation of the model's performance are essential to ensure its reliability and effectiveness over time.
3) Do you have any other insights from the data that can help the company 
   in the future (e.g., for future features that can be commercialized)
==> The data analysis and model insights suggest several potential areas for future features or services that could be commercialized by the company:
*Development of energy storage solutions: Given the potential fluctuations in renewable energy generation, there may be opportunities to offer energy storage solutions to customers to store surplus energy for later use.
*Smart home integration: Integration with smart home technology could allow customers to optimize their energy usage based on surplus energy availability, potentially leading to energy savings and increased efficiency.
*Community energy sharing programs: Facilitating energy sharing among neighbors or within communities could be explored as a service offering, promoting sustainability and community engagement.
*Demand response programs: Implementing demand response programs could incentivize customers to adjust their energy consumption patterns based on surplus energy availability, contributing to overall grid stability and efficiency.
